<h1>A documented version of JSch</h1>

<p>
As the official version of JSch contains only some example
files as documentation, I had the idea to add some Javadoc
comments to the public methods explaining what they do.
</p>

<p>
Here it is (not yet ready).
</p>
<p>
I based this on JSch 0.1.42, in the version contained in
Ubuntu's jsch source package (this is the first commit).
</p>

<p>
I hope this will be merged back to the official distribution,
as quite some big projects are using JSch, and this will be
easier with documentation.
