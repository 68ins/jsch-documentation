<h1>A documented version of JSch</h1>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/">official version of JSch</a>
contains nothing more than some
<a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/examples/">example files</a>
as documentation.
<p>
  This project adds some Javadoc comments to the public methods
  explaining what they do.
</p>

<p>You may want to have a look at the source (or check it out, or download it)
  in our <a href="https://github.com/ePaul/jsch-documentation">github repository</a>.</p>
<p>
  You can browse <a href="javadoc/">the current API</a>, automatically
  generated.
</p>

<p>
I hope this will be merged back to the official distribution,
as quite some big projects are using JSch, and this will be
easier with documentation.
